             Hi, my name is Morgan Breheny and I am currently a senior 
             at the Leeds School of Business at the University of Colorado, 
             Boulder studying Business Management with a dual emphasis in 
             Information Management and Data Analytics as well as Marketing 
             with a minor in Creative Design and Technology. With experience 
             in data analysis, graphic design and customer service, I strive 
             to combine my areas of study successfully in a technology-based 
             business world!
            </p>
